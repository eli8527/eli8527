### Hi! I’m Eric 👋

I craft thoughtfully considered and executed digital experiences for users through design and code. 

My focus on design led engineering and product has allowed me to make significant impact at organizations like the Eames Institute, MoMA, Google, and IDEO. 

With over 9 years of experience building products, I’m currently focused on creating something new at Orchard Analytics and also teach computer science at Parsons.
